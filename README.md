# Roblox Invite Generator
This allows you to create clickable invite pages using a roblox deeplink.
I recommend using [bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap) to get a roblox deeplink.

# What does this do?
This connects to an FTP Server provided by a webhosting company to generate a webpage from a roblox deeplink - this allows you to make clickable invite links. <br>
âš  I have only tested this on [InfinityFree](https://www.infinityfree.com/) so bugs may happen if you are using a different hosting provider.

# Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Edit main.py and set the `http_server`, `server`, `username` and `password` variables to the domains and credentials.

# How do I use this?
1. Use a tool like [bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap) to get a deeplink
2. Start the main.py
3. It would then ask for the deeplink - paste it in there (Windows - right click to paste in CMD)
4. It would generate a URL, you can copy (right click to copy on Windows) and send it
5. You can press enter to close.
